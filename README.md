# Diabetes-prediction-using-classification-project
<b>Project Overview</b><br>
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a set of health-related factors. Using a Diabetes Prediction Dataset, we explore the relationships between factors such as age, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose levels to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.<br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b><br>
The goal of this analysis is to investigate and classify diabetes accurately based on various health-related factors using machine learning classification algorithms.<br>
<br>
<b>Algorithms Used</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Na誰ve Bayes</li>
  <li>k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)</li>
  <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Dataset</b><br>
The dataset includes several health-related features, including:<br>
Age,
Gender,
Body Mass Index (BMI),
Hypertension,
Heart Disease,
Smoking History,
HbA1c Level, and
Blood Glucose Level.<br>
<br>
<b>Key Findings</b><br>
Both k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Decision Tree classifiers outperformed the Na誰ve Bayes classifier in terms of accuracy (based on cross-validation results).
kNN and Decision Tree models were identified as the better choices for diabetes prediction tasks.<br>
<br>
<b>Performance Metrics</b><br>
Model evaluation was done using cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.
The accuracy of kNN and Decision Tree was higher than Na誰ve Bayes for this specific dataset.<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning classification models for predicting diabetes based on various health factors. By comparing the performance of multiple models, we conclude that the kNN and Decision Tree models are more reliable for predicting diabetes when compared to Na誰ve Bayes.
